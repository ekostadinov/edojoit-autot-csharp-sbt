## Tips
1. Follow all good practices learned so far, like [High quality code](https://github.com/ekostadinov/edojoit-autot-csharp-sbt/tree/master/Track-I/09.High-quality-code). Not formatted code, poor naming, useless comments .etc may **lead to lower grade**.
1. Use what you've learned from doing your homeworks with [Strings](https://github.com/ekostadinov/edojoit-autot-csharp-sbt/tree/master/Track-I/05.Strings), [Loops](https://github.com/ekostadinov/edojoit-autot-csharp-sbt/tree/master/Track-I/03.Loops-and-Switch-operator) and [Data structures](https://github.com/ekostadinov/edojoit-autot-csharp-sbt/tree/master/Track-I/04.Data-structures).
1. Each problem will be exercised against unit tests, so be sure to cover the expected behaviour and corner cases.
