# Students and workers

## Description
Define abstract class `Human` with a first name and a last name. Define a new class `Student` which is derived from `Human` and has a new field â€” grade. Define class `Worker` derived from `Human` with a new property `WeekSalary` and `WorkHoursPerDay` and a method `MoneyPerHour()` that returns money earned per hour by the worker. Define the proper constructors and properties for this hierarchy.

  - Initialize a list of 10 students and sort them by grade in ascending order (use `LINQ` or `OrderBy()` extension method). 
	- Initialize a list of 10 workers and sort them by money per hour in descending order. 
	- Merge the lists and sort them by first name and last name.
